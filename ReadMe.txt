                              Battleship
========================================================================

A personal project I've developed recently in early October of 2017. It is
the classic game 'Battleship' which features 2 bot difficulties. Project time
took about a couple weeks. Also involves Object Oriented Programming.

Game features

Play against 2 bot difficulties:
    -Bronze Bot: Fires wrecklessly at your ships.
    -Challenger Bot: Fires until detection of one of your ships, and will seek 
        to obliterate it before moving onto the inevitable destruction of the
        remainder of your forces! Will you even dare square up against 
        the mighty formidable Challenger Bot?
