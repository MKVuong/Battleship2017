                              Battleship
========================================================================

A personal project where I've spent somewhere under 2 weeks and just recently
completed in early October of 2017. It was a great practice which involved
usage of Object Oriented Programming, and many programming concepts within.

Game features

Play against 2 different bot difficulties:
    -Bronze Bot: Fires wrecklessly at your ships.
    -Challenger Bot: Fires until detection of one of your ships, and will seek 
        to obliterate it before moving onto the inevitable destruction of the
        remainder of your forces! Will you even dare square up against 
        the mighty formidable Challenger Bot?
